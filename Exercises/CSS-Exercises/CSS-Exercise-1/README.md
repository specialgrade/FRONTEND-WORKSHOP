# ðŸŒˆ **CSS Design Project: Login Form**

## âœ¨ **Objective**
The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing **Login Form** using **HTML and CSS only**. This project will give you practice in designing, styling, and enhancing the user experience of a basic login form.

---

## ðŸ”§ **Instructions**

### 1. **Provided Files ðŸ”‚**
You will receive:
- **HTML File** (`login-form.html`): The basic HTML structure for the login form.
- **CSS File** (`form.css`): A blank CSS file where you will add your styles.

Your task is to design and style the login form using **only HTML and CSS**. No changes to the HTML file are required.

---

### 2. **Design Requirements ðŸŒŸ**

#### **Page Layout**
- Center the login form both **vertically** and **horizontally** on the screen.
- Use a clean, modern design inspired by professional login forms.

#### **Container Styling**
- Use a **shadow effect** for the container.
- Add **rounded corners** to make the container look smooth.
- Set a light background color (e.g., white, light gray) for the container, while the background of the page can use a gradient or solid light color.

#### **Logo**
- Center the logo at the top of the form.
- Add **space** between the logo and the form fields.

#### **Input Fields**
- Style the input fields to have padding, rounded corners, and a simple focus effect.
- Use placeholders for guidance (e.g., "Enter your username").

#### **Button**
- Style the login button with a unique color, hover effect, and pointer cursor.
- The button should stand out with a bold design to indicate it is clickable.

#### **Error Message**
- Style the error message to appear in **red text** and only show when there is an error.

### 3. **Form Elements ðŸ”²**
To style the following elements, you will use only HTML and CSS:

- **Container** (`.login-container`):
  - Centered on the page
  - Padding and rounded corners
  - Subtle shadow for depth

- **Logo** (`img`):
  - Centered and given spacing below it

- **Heading** (`h1`):
  - Large, bold font to draw attention

- **Input Fields** (`input[type="text"]`, `input[type="password"]`):
  - Styled with padding, border, and focus effects
  - Add hover and focus effects for interactivity

- **Submit Button** (`#loginButton`):
  - Unique color scheme
  - Hover effects and pointer cursor

- **Error Message** (`.error-message`):
  - Displayed in red text, initially hidden until triggered by form validation.

## ðŸ’¼ **Your Task**

### **Design the Login Form**

## ðŸŒŸ **Project Goals**

## ðŸ’¡ **Tips**
