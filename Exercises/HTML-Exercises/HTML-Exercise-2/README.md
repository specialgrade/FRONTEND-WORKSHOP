# 🎉 Tribute Page Project

✨ **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to create a simple tribute page using **HTML** only. The page will highlight an important individual, historical figure, or personal hero. It will showcase key details in an organized format using only HTML.

🔧 **Instructions**  
1. **Provided File 🗂️**  
   You will receive:
   - `exercise-2.html`: A basic HTML file where you will build the tribute page.

Your task is to design and structure a tribute page within the `exercise-2.html` file using only HTML.

2. **Page Structure 🏁**  
   The tribute page should contain the following sections:
   - **Header Section**: Contains the title of the tribute and a short description.
   - **Main Content Section**: This will have:
     - An image of the individual or figure you are tributing.
     - A biography section explaining who they are.
     - A list of their major accomplishments or qualities.
   - **Footer Section**: A simple footer acknowledging the page creator.

3. **Page Content 📝**  
   Use the following HTML structure to organize the content:
   
   - **Header Section**:
     - Title: `<h1>` with the name of the person you are tributing.
     - Short description: `<p>` with a brief summary of why they are important.
   
     Example:
     ```html
     <h1>Tribute to [Person's Name]</h1>
     <p>[Brief description of why this person is important]</p>
     ```

   - **Main Content Section**:
     - Image: Use the `<img>` tag to insert an image of the person.
     - Biography: Use `<p>` tags to describe who they are and why they are significant.
     - Accomplishments: Use an unordered list (`<ul>`) to list major accomplishments or qualities.

     Example:
     ```html
     <img src="path_to_image.jpg" alt="[Person's Name]">
     <h2>Biography</h2>
     <p>[Detailed biography of the individual]</p>
     ```

     - **Accomplishments Section**:  
     Use `<ul>` and `<li>` to list the person's achievements or qualities.
     
     Example:
     ```html
     <h2>Major Accomplishments</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Accomplishment 1</li>
       <li>Accomplishment 2</li>
       <li>Accomplishment 3</li>
     </ul>
     ```

   - **Footer Section**:
     - A simple footer message acknowledging the page creator.
   
     Example:
     ```html
     <footer>
       <p>Created by [Your Name]</p>
     </footer>
     ```
