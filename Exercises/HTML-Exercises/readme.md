HTML headings define titles and subtitles. There are six levels of headings from **`<h1>`** to **`<h6>`**, with `<h1>` being the most important.

### Example:

<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Sub-Subheading</h3>
```

## 📋 Lists
HTML supports two main types of lists:
- **Ordered List (`<ol>`)**: Numbered list.
- **Unordered List (`<ul>`)**: Bulleted list.

### Example:
```html
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>Item A</li>
    <li>Item B</li>
</ul>
```
