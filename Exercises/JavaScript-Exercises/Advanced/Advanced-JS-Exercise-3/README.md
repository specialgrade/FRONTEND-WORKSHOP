# JavaScript Advanced Exercise: Calculator Web App üßÆ

## üåü Goal

For this exercise, you'll create a **Calculator Web App** that includes all basic math operators and additional functionalities, including a **clear button**, **decimal support**, **backspace**, and **keyboard support**.

This task will help you practice **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **conditional logic**, and building a fully functional web-based calculator.

## üõ†Ô∏è Instructions

### 1. Provided Files üìÇ
You will receive:
- **`calculator-app.html`**: A simple HTML file containing the layout for the calculator.
- **`calculator-app.css`**: A CSS file for styling the calculator interface.

Your task is to implement the JavaScript functionality in the **`calculator-app.js`** file.

---

### 2. Sample Flow üéÆ
1. **Basic Operations**: Implement the basic math operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.
2. **Button Interaction**: When a user clicks a button, the corresponding digit or operator should appear on the display.
3. **Perform Calculations**: When the "=" button is clicked, the calculation should be performed using the operator and the numbers entered by the user.
4. **Clear Functionality**: The "AC" (Clear) button should reset the display and clear any stored values.
5. **Decimal Point**: Support decimal numbers by allowing users to input a decimal point but prevent multiple decimal points in the same number.
6. **Backspace**: Implement a backspace button to delete the last entered character.
7. **Keyboard Support**: Enable support for keyboard input. Users can press the number keys, operator keys, and `Enter` (or `=`) to perform calculations.

### üí° Hints

- **DOM Selection**:
  - Use `document.getElementById("id-name")` or `document.querySelector(".class-name")` to target elements by their `id` or class name.
  - Store these elements in variables for easier access.

- **Event Listeners**:
  - Use `.addEventListener('click', callback)` to listen for button clicks, triggering actions like entering digits, operators, or calculating the result.

- **Functions for Arithmetic**:
  - Create functions for the basic operations like `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
  - Implement a main `operate()` function that calls the correct operation based on the selected operator.

- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensure that inputs are valid before performing calculations. For example, display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by zero.

- **Handling Multiple Operations**:
  - Ensure the calculator evaluates only one operation at a time. If the user enters an operator before completing a previous operation, the result should be displayed, and the next operator should apply to the result.

- **Handling Long Decimals**:
  - Round results to a manageable number of decimal places, ensuring they don‚Äôt overflow the display.

- **Clear Function**:
  - Pressing the "AC" button should reset the display and all stored values.

### üß© Your Task

1. **Create Functions for Basic Math Operations**:
   - Functions for **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**. Test them in your browser's console first.

2. **Create a Function for Operation**:
   - Implement a function called `operate()` that takes two numbers and an operator, then performs the operation using the functions you created.

3. **Create Buttons for Digits and Operators**:
   - Implement buttons for digits (0‚Äì9) and basic operators (+, -, √ó, √∑), and ensure they populate the display when clicked.

4. **Implement the Equals Button**:
   - Use the `operate()` function to calculate the result when the "=" button is clicked.

5. **Implement a Clear Button**:
   - Implement a button ("AC") to reset the calculator and clear all inputs and results.

6. **Add Decimal Point Support**:
   - Allow users to input decimal points, ensuring that they can‚Äôt enter multiple decimals in the same number.

7. **Add Backspace Functionality**:
   - Implement a backspace button to allow users to remove the last digit entered.

8. **Enable Keyboard Support**:
   - Allow users to interact with the calculator using the keyboard (number keys, operators, `Enter`/`=` for equals).

### üõ†Ô∏è Things to Consider

1. **Prevent Invalid Input**:
   - Ensure that the calculator does not evaluate consecutive operator presses (e.g., 5 + + 6 should be invalid).

2. **Handle Division by Zero**:
   - If the user tries to divide by zero, display a message like "Math Error" and don‚Äôt let the app crash.

3. **Rounding Long Decimals**:
   - Ensure that the calculator rounds results to a manageable number of decimal places.

4. **Handling Multiple Numbers in Sequence**:
   - If the user inputs a number, followed by an operator, followed by another number, the calculator should compute the result for the first two numbers before accepting the next operator.

### üöÄ Extra Challenges

1. **Floating Point Numbers**:
   - Users can input floating point numbers if needed, but the display should handle decimal inputs carefully, ensuring no more than one decimal per number.

2. **Backspace Button**:
   - Implement a backspace button (`DEL`) that removes the last digit or operator entered.

3. **Keyboard Support**:
   - Implement keyboard support for all buttons. Use `keydown` event listeners to capture and process keyboard input.

Happy coding! üéâ
