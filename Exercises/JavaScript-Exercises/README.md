# JavaScript Exercises Repository

## üéØ Overview

Welcome to the JavaScript Exercises repository! This collection contains **basic** and **advanced** exercises designed to help you build a strong foundation in JavaScript. Whether you're just starting out with programming or looking for a refresher, these exercises will guide you through key concepts and real-world problem-solving techniques.

## üìù JavaScript Exercises

### **Basic Exercises**
The **basic exercises** are designed to help you get comfortable with JavaScript syntax and key programming concepts. You will explore essential topics such as:
- **Variables**: How to declare and use variables in JavaScript.
- **Data Types**: Understanding different types of data, including numbers, strings, and booleans.
- **Operators**: Using arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
- **Control Structures**: How to use `if`, `else`, `switch`, and loops to control the flow of your programs.

#### Examples of Basic Exercises:
1. **Console Calculator**: A simple console-based calculator that prompts users for input and performs arithmetic operations.
2. **Temperature Converter**: Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, allowing users to input values and select conversion options.

### **Advanced Exercises**
The **advanced exercises** are intended to deepen your understanding of JavaScript by introducing more complex topics such as:
- **DOM Manipulation**: How to interact with and modify the HTML and CSS of a webpage using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling**: Understanding how to attach event listeners to elements and handle user interactions like clicks or keyboard presses.

#### Examples of Advanced Exercises:
1. **Dynamic Counter**: A counter that increases or decreases its value when the user interacts with buttons. You will practice DOM manipulation and conditional logic to manage the counter's value dynamically.

## üîç Why Two Categories?

The exercises are divided into two categories: **basic** and **advanced**, to guide learners through the progression of learning JavaScript. 

- **Basic Exercises**: These cover the foundational aspects of JavaScript, focusing on the fundamental concepts necessary for any programmer. Understanding variables, data types, operators, and control structures is crucial before moving on to more complex tasks.

- **Advanced Exercises**: Once you are comfortable with the basics, the **advanced exercises** introduce you to **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**. These skills are essential for creating interactive web applications, where you'll apply your knowledge of JavaScript to interact with and modify the content of web pages.

## üöÄ Start with JavaScript Basics

If you're new to programming or JavaScript, it's highly recommended that you start with the **basic exercises**. They cover key topics like variables, data types, operators, and control structures, which are essential for understanding how JavaScript works. Once you're comfortable with the basics, move on to the **advanced exercises** to challenge yourself with more complex concepts like DOM manipulation and event handling.

**Note:** It is **NOT REQUIRED** to make the projects have the exact same functionality as the ones in the sample demo videos, but you can add more features as long as the core concepts are there.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

The exercises are organized into two main directories:
- **`Basics/`**: Contains all the basic exercises.
- **`Advanced/`**: Contains the advanced exercises.

Each directory includes the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to complete the exercises. Follow the instructions in each exercise's `README.md` to implement the solution and test your skills.
